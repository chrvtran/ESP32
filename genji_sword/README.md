"The cyborg Genji Shimada has made peace with the augmented body he once rejected, and in doing so, he has discovered a higher humanity. While wary of his past, he has acknowledged, and made peace with it. He (almost) constantly wears a mask, as, in his words, "I do not want people to fear me...or pity me."

Genji's sword is a katana named Ryū ichimonji (竜一文字); he maintains it personally and has never allowed anyone else to examine or repair it. It is paired with a traditional wakizashi sheathed horizontally on his lower back." https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Genji
